    "In preceding notebooks, you performed preliminary assessments of data quality and refined the question to be answered. You found a small number of data values that gave clear choices about whether to replace values or drop a whole row. You determined that predicting the adult weekend ticket price was your primary aim. You threw away records with missing price data, but not before making the most of the other available data to look for any patterns between the states. You didn't see any and decided to treat all states equally; the state label didn't seem to be particularly useful.\n",

    "In this notebook you'll start to build machine learning models. Before even starting with learning a machine learning model, however, start by considering how useful the mean value is as a predictor. This is more than just a pedagogical device. You never want to go to stakeholders with a machine learning model only to have the CEO point out that it performs worse than just guessing the average! Your first model is a baseline performance comparitor for any subsequent model. You then build up the process of efficiently and robustly creating and assessing models against it. The development we lay out may be little slower than in the real world, but this step of the capstone is definitely more than just instructional. It is good practice to build up an understanding that the machine learning pipelines you build work as expected. You can validate steps with your own functions for checking expected equivalence between, say, pandas and sklearn implementations."

    "So far, you've treated ski resort data as a single entity. In machine learning, when you train your model on all of your data, you end up with no data set aside to evaluate model performance. You could keep making more and more complex models that fit the data better and better and not realise you were overfitting to that one set of samples. By partitioning the data into training and testing splits, without letting a model (or missing-value imputation) learn anything about the test split, you have a somewhat independent assessment of how your model might perform in the future. An often overlooked subtlety here is that people all too frequently use the test set to assess model performance _and then compare multiple models to pick the best_. This means their overall model selection process is  fitting to one specific data set, now the test split. You could keep going, trying to get better and better performance on that one data set, but that's  where cross-validation becomes especially useful. While training models, a test split is very useful as a final check on expected future performance."

    "You could keep going, trying different values of k, training a model, measuring performance on the test set, and then picking the model with the best test set performance. There's a fundamental problem with this approach: _you're tuning the model to the arbitrary test set_! If you continue this way you'll end up with a model works well on the particular quirks of our test set _but fails to generalize to new data_. The whole point of keeping a test set is for it to be a set of that new data, to check how well our model might perform on data it hasn't seen.\n",

    "The way around this is a technique called _cross-validation_. You partition the training set into k folds (**Note**: The use of notation k here should not be confused with selecting different values of k features as explained above. The selection of k features is different from partitioning the training data set into k fold), train our model on k-1 of those folds, and calculate performance on the fold not used in training. This procedure then cycles through k times with a different fold held back each time. Thus you end up building k models on k sets of data with k estimates of how the model performs on unseen data but without having to touch the test set."

    "These results suggest that vertical drop is your biggest positive feature. This makes intuitive sense and is consistent with what you saw during the EDA work. Also, you see the area covered by snow making equipment is a strong positive as well. People like guaranteed skiing! The skiable terrain area is negatively associated with ticket price! This seems odd. People will pay less for larger resorts? There could be all manner of reasons for this. It could be  an effect whereby larger resorts can host more visitors at any one time and so can charge less per ticket. As has been mentioned previously, the data are missing information about visitor numbers. Bear in mind,  the coefficient for skiable terrain is negative _for this model_. For example, if you kept the total number of chairs and fastQuads constant, but increased the skiable terrain extent, you might imagine the resort is worse off because the chairlift capacity is stretched thinner."

Then highlight that you built a linear model and the features that found. Comment on the estimate of its performance from cross-validation and whether its performance on the test split was consistent with this estimate. Also highlight that a random forest regressor was tried, what preprocessing steps were found to be best, and again what its estimated performance via cross-validation was and whether its performance on the test set was consistent with that. State which model you have decided to use going forwards and why. This summary should provide a quick overview for someone wanting to know quickly why the given model was chosen for the next part of the business problem to help guide important business decisions."

    "<font color=blue> **A: 1** Here, we start by separating the Big Mountain Resort data from the remaining data of all ski resorts. This remaining data is preprocessed and trained to builid some initial ML models, in particular, linear regression model and random forest regression model to gain further insight into the data relationship. We remark here that some insight on data relationship was also gained in the previous (EDA) step. In EDA step, it was  also conjectured that the three categorical features (such as `Name`, `Region`, and `state`) could be considered by using One-hot encoding scheme. This would, however, increase the number of features. We do not pursue it for now to keep the current step relatively simple. Beside, some relevant state data (dataframe `state_summary`) was already merged into the ski resort dataset (dataframe `ski_data`; see Line 77 of Jupyter Notebook 03ExploratoryDataAnalysisBigMountain_Das.ipynb). So, we drop the three categorical features from the data set for now. Leaving aside `AdultWeekend` which is the target feature or target variable, there are 32 independent features that are considered in this current data preprocessing and training step. We may, however, re-visit later to see if a better ML model can be built by additionally including, at least, the `state` feature as another independent variable. But, we will not pursue this step for now.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=blue> Prior to building two initial ML models based on `sklearn`'s `LinearRegression` and `RandomForestRegressor` classes, we explore the case when the mean value of `AdultWeekend` of the training data set is taken as predictor. The quality of the mean-value predictor is measured against the test split by estimating the three error metrics as  $R^2$ = -0.0031,  _mean absolute error_  = \\\\$19.1361, and _root mean squared error_ = \\\\$24.1130.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=blue> To see improvement beyond this baseline model of average price of `AdultWeekend`, linear regression model is next considered. The missing values of the train and test data set are filled in (imputed) and two cases are considered. In one case (Case 1), median values of the train data set are used to fill in, and in the other case (Case 2), mean values of the train data set are assigned to impute. In Case 1, we obtain  $R^2$ = 0.7210,  _mean absolute error_  = \\\\$9.4070, and _root mean squared error_ = \\\\$12.7174. This implies that this model is significantly better than the baseline model because the linear regression model explains over 72% of variance of the test data set, and provides estimate of ticket price, on average, within about \\\\$9 of the real price in the sense of _mean absolute error_ (MAE) metric (contrast it with the MAE value of about \\\\$19 otained in the baseline model) and within about \\\\$12 of the actual price in the sense _root mean squared error_ (RMSE) metric. In Case 2, a linear regression model is built by imputing the missing values with the corresponding mean values of the train data set. The resulting model here is found to perform not much different from the model obtained in Case 1. \n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=blue> The reason that both the linear regression models in Case 1 and Case 2 perform almost same is possibly that they are likely overfitting the data because all the 32 features are used to train the models. For a better predictive capability, it is better to select the k best features by appropriately choosing k. This is what is done next by relying on `sklearn`'s `f_regression` scoring function to select the k dominant features. Here, the missing values are imputed by the median because it was observed earlier in EDA step that many distributions of the features were skewed. We start by choosing k = 10 and the top 5 dominant features along with their linear model coefficients are reported:\n",
    "\n",
    "* vertical_drop:        10.3848\n",
    "* fastQuads:             6.1614\n",
    "* Snow Making_ac:        5.9890\n",
    "* total_chairs:          5.5591\n",
    "* Runs:                  4.1130\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=blue> The variable `vertical_drop` is the biggest positive feature here. The model yields $R^2$ = 0.6260, MAE = \\\\$11.2018, and RMSE = \\\\$14.7237 against the test split. However, it is worse than the previous model with all the 32 features. We then try k = 15 to see if there could be any improvement. Against the test split, the resulting linear regression model performs very similar to the model with k = 10. The 5 most dominant features are also same as the ones obtained for k = 10. The `vertical_drop` and `fastQuads` are the 2 top positive features with significantly higher coefficients (10.3255 and 8.0061, respectively) than rest of the features. In both cases (k = 10 and k = 15), `SkiableTerrain_ac` and `trams` are the top two negative features with negative coefficients having values $\\thicksim$-5.0 and $\\thicksim$-4.0, respectively.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=blue> At this stage, we remark that if a different set of training split is chosen, then the performances of the two models (with k = 10 and k = 15) are likely to display some differences due to the variability/uncertainty in the training dataset. To address this issue, we employ the cross-validation technique to estimate the mean and standard deviation of $R^2$ metric of 5 linear regression models (i.e., based on 5-fold cross-validation) for k = 15. The mean and stadard deviation of $R^2$ metric are, respectively, found to be be 0.6327 and 0.0950. Note that the cross-validation result is exclusively based on the training dataset and independent of the test dataset. This can be used to define possible range as (mean $\\pm$ std) = (0.6327 $\\pm$ 0.0950) = (0.5377, 0.7277), within which we would expect the values of $R^2$ for most of other different test dataset to fall. For example, the value of $R^2$ = 0.6376 obtained earlier for k = 15 against the test split falls in this range. Such consistency of the cross-valitation result with the performance of the linear regression model against the test split provides certain confidence about the predictive capability of the developed model in a similar but unknown setting.\n",

    "<font color=blue> The next objective is to determine (thorugh cross-validation) the optimum value of k which will result in the highest possible score or the maximum possible value of $R^2$. To achieve this, we consider all possible values of k (ranging from 1 to 32) with 5-fold cross-validation technqiue, and imputing the missing values by median (Section 4.9.8: Hyperparameter search using GridSearchCV). The best estimator is obtained for k = 8 features with highest mean value of $R^2$ metric (i.e., average of 5 values of $R^2$'s) as 0.6815 for which the standard deviation is found to be 0.0460. This provides an estimate of possible range of $R^2$ metric as  (mean $\\pm$ std)= (0.6815 $\\pm$ 0.0460) = (0.6355, 0.7275), implying that the variability in model performance is almost 50% lower than what (see the previous paragraph) we obtained earlier for k = 15 best features and with 5-fold cross-validation. This lower variability, however, can be an issue because the value of $R^2$ metric against a test dataset not used in cross-validation, is likely to lie outside the range (0.6355, 0.7275)! **If this happens, then it means that variability in the training dataset used in cross-validation fails to capture variability of the test data set**. This will call for more data collection for reliable ML model building and better business decision! The top 5 dominant features of the linear regression model with k = 8 are enumerated below:\n",

    "<font color=blue> As this model is not exposed yet to the test split, we evaluate its performance against the test split (see Section 4.11.1: Linear regression model performance) and obtain $R^2$ = 0.5968,   MAE = \\\\$11.7935, and RMSE = \\\\$15.2876. The value of $R^2$ = 0.5968 lies outside the range (0.6355, 0.7275)! It, therefroe, implies that more data would be useful for better model development and business decision. **This inference appears to contradict the conclusion noted in Section 4.12: Data quantity assessment**. However, this is not case because the analysis of Section 4.12 is not aware of the test split for which $R^2$ = 0.5968 is estimated in Section 4.11.1. Nevertheless, this observation demonstrates that a new dataset _may_ bring new information. If an existing ML model or data analysis similar to what is presented in Section 4.12 is not updated by incorporating this new information, then we will have a suboptimal ML model with less predictive capability.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=blue> Furthermore, the performance of the linear regression model with k = 8 against _this particular test split_ does not display superiority (in terms of all the three error metrics) over the previous three (with k = 10 best features, k = 15 best features, and all the 32 features) because the value of $R^2$ = 0.5968 is less than that of the other three models against the _same test split_. According to this (best) linear regression model with k = 8, an estimate of the ticket price, on average, would be within \\\\$11.7935 $\\approx$ \\\\$12 of the real price in the sense of MAE metric.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=blue> As highlighted at the beginning of this summary, two classes of models, i.e., linear regression model and random forest regression model are investigated in this current data preprocessing and training step. We now summarize the salient points of the random forest regressor model. This model is constructed by using `sklearn`'s `RandomForestRegressor` class. \n",
    "The `RandomForestRegressor` class has several parameters that can be optimized. However, we only optimize the number of trees defined by the parameter `n_estimators`. The cross-validated grid-search technique based on `sklearn`'s `GridSearchCV` is employed for this purpose. We adopt 5-fold cross-validation. The `GridSearchCV()` exhasutively seraches over a parameter grid of `n_estimators` to estimate an _optimum_ value of number of trees of the `RandomForestRegressor` estimator. The parameter grid is defined by generating 20 evenly spaced points in the range $[10^1, 10^3]$ of the logspace. We consider both the mean and median as strategies for imputing the missing values. \n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=blue> It is found that imputing with the median provided the best estimator of `n_estimators` which is obtained as 69. For this optimal number of trees, the top 4 important features are reported below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* fastQuads\n",
    "* Runs\n",
    "* Snow Making_ac\n",
    "* vertical_drop\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=blue> We remark here that standard deviations of the model parameters are also estimated to assess the variability of the best linear regression model (k = 8) and the best random forest regression model (`n_estimators` = 69). This is done by relying on cross-validation technique using only the tarining dataset. See figures in Line 109 and Line 154. It can be noted from these two plots that the coefficients of variationas of the imoprtant featuers are typically about 10% to 15% or even more. We also note here that the standard scaling, `StandardScaler()`, is found to be useful for linear regression model but not for random forest regression model.\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=blue> We now comment on performance of the best random regression model (`n_estimators` = 69). The mean value of $R^2$ metric (i.e., average of 5 values of $R^2$'s based on 5-fold cross-validation) is determined to be 0.7097, while the standard deviation is found to be 0.0645. This, thus, provides an estimate of possible range of $R^2$ metric as (mean $\\pm$ std)= (0.7097 $\\pm$ 0.0645) = (0.6452, 0.7742). This range is relatively wider than the corresponding range, i.e., (0.6355, 0.7275), of the best linear regression model (k = 8). The performance of the best random regression model is also evaluated against the test split (see Section: 4.11.2: Random forest regression model performance). The following error metrics against the test split are found to be: $R^2$ = 0.7515, MAE = \\\\$9.5377, and RMSE = \\\\$12.0019. These values can be contrasted against the respective values of the best linear regression model (i.e.,  $R^2$ = 0.5968,   MAE = \\\\$11.7935, and RMSE = \\\\$15.2876). This comparison shows that the best random regression model is superior to the best linear regression model in terms of all the three error metrics. Additionally, performance on _the particular test set_ of the best random forest regression model is found to be consistent with its estimated performance via cross-validation because the value of $R^2$ = 0.7515 obtained against the test split lies in the cross-validation range (0.6452, 0.7742) which only depends on the training dataset but not on the test dataset! Therefore, **the random forest regression model would be used going forwards**."
